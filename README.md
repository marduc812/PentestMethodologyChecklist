# Pentesting Methodology Checklist

The following projects contains a list of pentesting methodologies that can used during your test.

### Why use this?

- Every methodology is an `html` file that can be used by every browser
- All tests are checkboxes that can be changed when your testcase is done
- Progressbar shows you the progress of your test
- No extra software is required
- Import / Export functionality
- `Everything is clientside`, so `no information is getting stored on the web server`


### ToDo

- Add docker image
